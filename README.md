# Plant Monitoring System Using IoT
## Overview
- The aim of this project is to automate agriculture using IoT.
- In this project we used different type of sensors for collecting data from Agriculture.
- I Used Blynk Cloud for accessing sensors from anywhere from world.
- We can autom automate Water pump.

## How It Works
- I Used Soil Moisture Sensor, DHT11 Sensor(Tempereture And Humidity) for collecting Data.
- After collecting data from sensor it will send to Blynk Cloud
- Blynk can control Hardware devices from remotely, it can display sensor data, it can store data, vizualize it and do many other cool things.

- Soil Moisture Sensor collects moiture presents in soil i.e how much quantity of water present in the water.
- DHT11 Sensor is collecting Tempereture and Humidity present in the air surround the agriculture.
- Blynk Cloud will show all collected data in the form of Graphs and Charts so we can easily monitor our plants from anywhere.
